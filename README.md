## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Located near the top of the script:

```bash
SERVERBACKUPFOLDER="/media/deano/HDD1/Backup"
TMPFOLDER="/tmp"
NUMTOKEEP=5
EXCLUDE=("/lost+found" "/media" "/mnt" "/proc" "/sys" "/storage" "/virtual")

    Ensure the SERVERBACKUPFOLDER points to your desired external or mounted backup location.

    Modify EXCLUDE to skip any folders during backup (useful for volatile or irrelevant paths).

üíæ Backup Modes
üîÅ Full Backup

    Archives / directory excluding defined paths

    Each top-level folder is compressed into separate .tar.bz2 files

    Stored in:

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/full/YYYYMMDD_HHMM/

‚ûï Incremental Backup

    Backs up files changed since last backup

    Stored in:

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/incremental/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

üåÄ Rsync Snapshot

    Efficient, deduplicated backups using rsync

    Stored in:

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/rsync_snapshots/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

‚úÖ Backup Verification

Each backup folder includes:

    SHA256SUMS.txt ‚Äì checksums for all tarballs

    verify.log ‚Äì result of SHA256 verification

Run Option 11 to verify the last full backup.
üîÅ Restore

Option 12: Restore System Backup

Choose from:

    Full Backup

    Incremental Backup

    Rsync Snapshot

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Restoring overwrites system files ‚Äî proceed with caution.

üßπ Cleanup

    System Cleanup: removes unused packages and old logs

    Backup Cleanup: deletes stale .pid and log files in /tmp

üìÅ Output Files
Full Backups

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/full/YYYYMMDD_HHMM/

        .tar.bz2 files (per top-level folder)

        restore.txt, SHA256SUMS.txt, verify.log, lastran.txt

Incremental Backups

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/incremental/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

        .tar.bz2 of changed files

        lastran.txt, SHA256SUMS.txt, verify.log

Rsync Snapshots

    $SERVERBACKUPFOLDER/rsync_snapshots/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

        Full filesystem copy (deduplicated)

Temporary Files

    /tmp/files-to-backup.*

    /tmp/*.pid

    /tmp/restore_rsync_*.log

üîß Requirements

The script installs missing tools as needed, but requires:

    tar, rsync, find, sha256sum, df, gsettings, whiptail

    apt, flatpak, docker, node, etc.
